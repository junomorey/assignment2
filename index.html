            <h3>Description of the piece</h3>
            <p>As the title might imply, this piece has a dark and mysterious tone to
              it. The hollow, metallic, distant sounds throughout the song seem to fade
              in and out, almost like a being breathing in and out. There is not really
              any melody or concrete rhythm - it is more of a continuous blend of sounds.
              Especially prominent in the beginning of the song, there is a constant
              somewhat distorted sound resembling trickling water - like a stream or
              maybe even underwater. Sublte chimes and rising cymbols varying in intensity
              &nbsp;are mixed in to the other sounds, creating a sort of 'shine' in the
              music. &nbsp;After about 3 and a half minutes, we begin to hear sounds
              that might resemble creatures or animals. These consist of high pitched
              sweeps (which, to me sound similar to calls of a dolphin or whale) and
              shorther 'chirps', sometimes seeming to complement eachother - like an
              interaction between multiple creatures. At around the halfway point (5
              and a half minutes) There is a buildup in intensity that mysteriously resolves
              back to the normal state of the song. The frequency of the sweeps and 'animal
              sounds' increases in the second half of the song. At about 9 and a half
              minutes, there seems to be some sort of interaction depicted, possibly
              a fight between some of these 'creatures' &nbsp;represented with sweeps
              and croaking sounds.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Romanticism</h3>
            <p>This piece relates to the era of romanticism in the sense that it's a
              very expressive piece &nbsp;whose sounds seem to represent a theme in nature,
              and its dark and mysterious tone could potentially be depicting something
              supernatural. &nbsp;One romantic pieces that had strong ties to nature
              is Schubert's "Der Jungling an der quelle". The piano accompaniment in
              the first of these two songs, in my view, seems to resemble the trickling
              of a stream - similar to the water sound effects in "Under the Ice", however
              in a less direct way. &nbsp;"Under the Ice" is very different from traditional
              romantic pieces in the sense that there is no concrete melody or rhythm,
              only pure sound.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>The story that I hear</h3>
            <p>If I were to create a story out of this song, it would be of a person
              out on a frozen lake &nbsp;having an out of body experience. &nbsp;They
              might be looking up at their body from underneath the ice, in the water.
              Things are moving in slow motion and the 'breathing' of the sounds represents
              their own breath. The sweeping 'animal sounds' represent figures in the
              distant dark water that are trying to communicate with the person, more of these figures appearring throughout the song.<br></p>
